Hi, My name is Kevin Riungu. I am a data scientist with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. 
In my role, I leverage advanced analytical techniques to extract meaningful patterns from complex datasets, helping businesses make data driven decisions that drive growth and innovation.
</n>Recently, I developed a predictive model to reduce customer churn by a significant margin for a major telecom company
What sets me apart is my ability to not only analyze data but also communicate findings effectively to diverse stakeholder, thus bridging the gap between technical insights and business objectives.
I am always eager to explore new opportunities and collaborate on exciting projects. I'd love to discuss how i can contribute to your team's success.
